  "Count me out. Nothing President Trump can say will make me think of Canada as my enemy. The whole idea is stupid. It makes us seem irrational and unreliable. It’s just noise. Canadians are cousins.",
  "There's no reason to beat around the bush on this: Trump's Ukraine plan is literally just to make Ukraine an American colony. He's trying to divide up the country with Russia like Germany did with Poland.",

  "I’m also own a company employing over 150 staff in 7 counties and started in 1999. \nI’m in Europe. \n\nThe predator is Trump and his tariffs and lies. Not Europe. Europe fights for a fair business environment. Monopolies are not good for industry and they are banned in Europe, which brings healthy competition, instead of the American way of letting companies like Meta, Google and Amazon become so big they dominate and are difficult to compete with. This is bad for business in general. \nThe whole US stock market is based on the sucess of these few companies. Take them away and the stock market crashes. Not good as you know to have so much power and reliance on a hand full of companies. It’s like having 2-3 companies that generate 90% of your companies revenue. One drops out and your whole business is in a mess. \n\nWe have a very fair business environment in Europe.

  "Important to realize that Trump’s approach to Canada and Greenland is like his approach to Ukraine. It’s not even American imperialism. It is America enabling Russian imperialism. It’s America destroying its own best alliances, cutting itself off from its own crucial bases, making a Russian nuclear first strike on the US easier, opening Arctic territories that were once safe to Russian expansion. That’s the one logic that makes it all make sense. There is no conception of US interests, including an imperial one, in which this makes sense.",

Pendant trop longtemps, les politiciens corrompus se sont enrichis au crochet  des travailleurs 🇺🇸 tout en esquivant la responsabilité. \nIl est temps d'exposer qui nous a volé et de rendre le pouvoir à We the People. \nTrump n'a pas peur de secouer le système - et c'est pourquoi le marais le craint. \nImaginez la panique à D.C. s'ils devaient réellement répondre de leurs transactions louches. \nLe peuple 🇺🇸 mérite la vérité, la transparence et la justice. \nQue les audits commencent❗️",
